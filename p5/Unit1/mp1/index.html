    <h3> Ruby is the birthstone protector of July, making her one of the 12 Guardian Zodiacs. In order to blend in, they have a human form with the exception of the stone on their forehead that can be covered. Like the other Guardians, Ruby's true form is that of a mythical creature of tales and fantasy. Even with all their strength and powers, they stay in hiding and separate until they are needed and brought together again. </h3>
