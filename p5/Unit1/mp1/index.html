    <h3> Ruby is the birthstone protector of July, making her one of the 12 Guardian Zodiacs. In order to blend in, they have a human form with the exception of the stone on their forehead that can be covered. Like the other Guardians, Ruby's true form is that of a mythical creature of tales and fantasy. With their strength and powers greater than any other beings, they stay in hiding and separate until they have to transform and save the world. </h3>
